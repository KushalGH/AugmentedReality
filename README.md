# Day 1
Today, I searched about Augmented reality. So, to start, what is Augmented Reality? Any day to day thing is reality. and suppose we want some object in that reality, that is called the augmented object. and we can perform multiple actions like gestures, etc on that object.


Found some nice links, that are good for Day1.
